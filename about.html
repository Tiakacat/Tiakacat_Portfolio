        <div class="about-text">
          <p>
            I'm 39 years old, I have 2 master degrees: Chinese language
            (philology) from Kyiv National Taras Schevchenko University and
            International Communications from National Chengchi University
            (National University of Governance), Taipei, Taiwan (Government
            scholarship). For 12 years I've been working as a communications
            (public relations) pro. I also did a lot of professional courses and
            programs from the best institutions - both in Ukraine and abroad.
          </p>
          <p>
            I graduated Chartered Institute of Public Relations (UK), Kyiv
            Mohyla Business School (Ukraine), European Business Association
            (Ukraine), demonstrating remarkable results during studying. I'm PR
            and marketing practitioner with a solid field experience
            (strategies, tactics, campaigns, media relations, copywriting) in
            FMCG, HoReCa, aviation, energetics etc, and theoretical knowledge.
            For the last 4 years I've been working for BROCARD (the biggest
            beauty retailer in Ukraine) as a communications director. I created
            the PR function by myself - it did not exist in the company before I
            had joined the team.
